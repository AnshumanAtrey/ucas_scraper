      "about": "With £200 million invested in our campuses, our university in the centre of Birmingham - one of the UK's biggest, youngest and most exciting cities - is a place where you can thrive, make new friends and expand your horizons.\nOne area where we really stand out is our award-winning support, including giving all full-time, UK undergraduates starting in September 2025 a free £5,000 to help with living costs, which doesn't have to be paid back.\nWith one of the most diverse student bodies anywhere, our students go on to become passionate engineers, teachers, leaders, builders, nurses, paramedics, physiotherapists, business and financial entrepreneurs, food and nutrition experts, psychologists, designers, health and social care leaders, sports therapists, and digital innovators. We are also marketing, tourism, hospitality and aviation management specialists and are renowned across the world as a centre of excellence.",
      "whatMakesUsDifferent": "A smaller university, but with big industry connections, we are committed to ensuring everyone has the opportunity to succeed in a supportive environment. Our students vouch for this and we were voted best in the region for student support, as well as postgraduate and international, at the 2024 Whatuni Student Choice Awards - voted for by students themselves.\nEasily connected to the rest of the UK and the world, our location is also a draw for students as we are surrounded by booming businesses, green spaces, vibrant nightlife and a mix of cultures right on our doorstep.\nThe best way to find out about us is to attend one of our open days, where you will be made to feel very welcome. You can look around our campus buildings and facilities, see our accommodation, chat to our students about student life, meet your lecturers and see for yourself why we are a unique place to study.",
