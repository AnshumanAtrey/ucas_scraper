      "about": "We’ve been a specialist university focusing on art, design, media and performance since 1883.\nWith just over 3,000 students based on our single campus, we’re a close-knit community of creative and collaborative innovators, who all share a common commitment to the arts. We invest heavily in our teaching facilities to provide students with everything needed to fulfil their creative potential and thrive as graduates.\nYou’ll be taught by our course teams who are experts in their fields, bringing years of industry experience into a unique and creative academic environment.\nCourses are delivered through a range of methods, including studio practice; lectures; screenings; seminars (staff and student-led); group presentations and critiques; and external visits to galleries, theatres and exhibitions.",
      "whatMakesUsDifferent": "Our courses are designed to equip you with the skills and knowledge to succeed in today’s changing economy. Our facilities support this approach – they’re state-of-the-art and in parallel with current creative industry practice.\nWe’re committed to studio-based learning, ensuring you have access to equipment and facilities you'll find in the 'real world'. More importantly, all these courses sit alongside each other on our single campus, and unlike many other art schools, are open access to all students across the university – whatever their chosen course. The openness underpins the cross-discipline respect and understanding that’s fundamental to the successful collaboration and the blended careers which typify the creative industries. It also means our graduates leave with a ready-made network of peers to support their career journey.",

        "Why AUB?",
        "We’ve been a specialist university focusing on art, design, media and performance since 1883.",
        "With just over 3,000 students based on campus (approximately 150 of which are postgraduate), AUB is a close-knit community of creative and collaborative innovators, who all share a common commitment to the arts. The university fosters an environment where boundaries can be pushed, beliefs and practices can be challenged, and conventions can be tested.",
        "We offer a range of Master of Arts degrees and supervision for students who wish to undertake a Research degree (MPhil/PhD). Research degrees are validated by the University of the Arts London (UAL).",
        "In the Research Excellence Framework (REF), over 40% of AUB’s university research was deemed to be ‘internationally excellent’ or ‘world-leading’.",
        "Based on the border between Bournemouth and Poole, means that AUB is close to all the best student spots – including clubs and restaurants, art galleries and shops and miles of sandy beaches.",
        "Our campus is a living, breathing, academic environment for creativity. It’s where you’ll make amazing things happen. We invest in the technology and spaces that equip you for life in your chosen field, and ensure that you have access to the equipment and facilities you’ll find in the real world."
